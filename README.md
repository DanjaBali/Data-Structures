Data Structures - Project

• In this project I was asked to implement a binary search tree to allow duplicates.

– Hint: Each node store a data structure of items that are
considered duplicates (using the first item in this structure) to
control branching.

• In addition to the existing operators of the tree, I was asked to implement also the
following: 

– Return number of duplicates of an element

– Find and replace all duplicates of an element A with element B

– Show all the tree together with the duplicates (pre-order, in-order,
post-order, level-order)

– Remove all existing duplicates (leaving only one copy) of an
element

– Remove only one copy of the existing duplicates of an element

– Remove all existing duplicates (leaving only one copy) for all the
duplicated elements in tree

– Print all elements that have duplicates together with the number of
duplicates

– Print the number of all the duplicates in the tree

– Show only the nodes that have/do not have duplicate
